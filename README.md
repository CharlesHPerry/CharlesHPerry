## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# My name is Charles Perry 
  I am a young developer out of West Seattle, I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's remote software engineering immersive course. I love the functional side of programming, as well as a good bit of bug squashing ðŸ¦Ÿ. On the side I enjoy a variety of sports and my girlfriend says I am obsessed with cars (I don't know how true that is).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding full time work. If you have any leads or advice contact me, I will be very grateful!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some computer science fundamentals.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with styling, CSS and I just don't get along well, I both don't have a great design eye and find CSS very finicky.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite childhood toy was Lego, and you can still find me asking for them as a present.

If you would like to get in touch for any reason email me @ chuckhperry@gmail.com
