## Hi there 👋
# My name is Charles Perry 
  I am a young developer out of West Seattle, I am a recent graduate of General Assembly's remote software engineering immersive course. I love the functional side of programming, as well as a good bit of bug squashing 🦟. On the side I enjoy a variety of sports and my girlfriend says I am obsessed with cars (I don't know how true that is).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on finding full time work. If you have any leads or advice contact me, I will be very grateful!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some computer science fundamentals.
- 🤔 I'm always interested to hear peoples favorite css tricks, and to add to my arsenal. If you have a cool one you wanna share, contact me!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite childhood toy was Lego, and you can still find me asking for them as a present.

If you would like to get in touch for any reason email me @ chuckhperry@gmail.com
